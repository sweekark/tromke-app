<h3>Policy</h3>
Last Revised: June 7, 2014
<br>
This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the Web site and mobile application owned and operated by Tromke. ("Tromke" "we" or "us") located at www.tromke.com (the "Site") and the Tromke service accessed through our mobile application, collectively (the "service").. The Policy is designed to tell you how we collect and use personal information (as defined below) so you can make an informed decision about using our Site and the Tromke service. Please read this statement before submitting any personal information to us.

<br>
<br>
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION
<br>
As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, credit card number or other account number), and information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Tromke service, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or service or categories of Site and service users, from which any personal information has been removed. For example, information that forty-seven percent of the Site's registered users identify themselves as male, is aggregate information. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.
<br>
<br>
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
<br>
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use the various services and activities available through the Tromke service. At several places within our mobile application, we may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, if you register for the mobile application or service, send us an email, or submit content, we may collect your name, photo, demographic information that you provide. In addition, from time to time we may collect contact or other personal or demographic information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys or promotional offers.
<br>
<br>
When events (Troms - Stickers, Photos, Questions) are posted, the Tromke service will automatically collect location information from your mobile device and/or your mobile carrier. When you use the service, via your mobile device, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on the application and through the service. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. If you no longer wish to allow us to collect and use your location information, you may discontinue the use of the service.
<br>
<br>
We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personal information, we would treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions.
<br><br>
Mobile Analytics
<br>
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
<br>
<br>
Usage and Disclosure
<br>
<br>
In general, we use personal information we may collect (such as your name or social network information) to facilitate your use of the mobile application and Tromke service, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of the Site and mobile application and of our service, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect:
<ul>
<li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;</li>
<li>to ensure that the application is working correctly and that you are being served the most recent version;</li>
<li>to allow other users of the service that you designate to temporarily view your whereabouts in real-time;</li>
<li>to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Site and our information and services; and</li>
<li>for the specific purpose for which the information was provided.</li>
</ul>
In addition, if you so indicate in the event of sharing your contact information with us, we may use the information we collect to send you news and product and service updates, including contacting you about our services, products, activities, special events or offers and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes, including notifications about new features and or improvements to the Site or our products and services;
<br>
<br>
We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, and may combine this information with the other personal information we have about you. In such cases, this Policy governs our use and disclosure of such information.
<br>
<br>
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?
<br>
<br>
We do not sell, share, or rent any personal information to third parties in any ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy. However, we may provide other non-personal information and aggregate information to third parties without your authorization. With regard to SMS functionality, when Tromke sends location information from your mobile device to those recipients chosen by you, your phone number will be provided to them along with such identifying information as you choose, such as name and/or photo. We may share your contact information with third parties, but only if you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties. In the event that we engage or partner with third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the operation of the Site and our services ("Service Providers"), we may share personal information with such Service Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. Service Providers include network operations and service monitoring (NOC) providers, server hosting companies, customer support service providers, and analytics services. In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. When you use these services, you would be providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information would be subject to such party's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.
<br>
<br>
You should only share your location with people you know and trust not to convey your location to others. You should also note that personal information you share with others may be forwarded and information you post to public areas of the Site, may become publicly available. For example, information you post in your Profile, or any other interactive areas, or other information that is provided for the purpose of being shared may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Site constitutes your consent to share such information publicly.
<br>
<br>
We also may disclose personal information when we are required to comply with the law (e.g. a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of personal information. In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the Company.

<br>
Please note: The Site and service may provide links to other sites, or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of any Web site that collects personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you entered the Tromke Site through another Web site, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that site, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating site before providing any personal information to that site. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by us.
